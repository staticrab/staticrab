# staticrab

A library for calculation of various correlation measuers.

The goal of this mini library is not to replace [Scipy stack](https://www.scipy.org/), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) nor [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) but rather to complement them.

It requires to have installed the `staticrab-backend` installed.

```
pip install staticrab-backend
```
